Is it possible to change the displayed logo?
********************************************

You may want to change the default logo for your own one; and you can do that using GLPI Network Cloud!

Log in with `Super-Admin` account on your GLPI instance, you just need to install and activate the "Branding" plugin which is on the list of pre-deployed plugins (`Configuration -> Plugins` menu).

Once activated, you have a new `Branding` tab in the general configuration of GLPI (`Configuration -> General` menu), allowing you to upload your logos (home page and top left logos).

Can I customize my GLPI Network Cloud URL platform with my own (sub)domain?
***************************************************************************

Yes, it is possible for free.
