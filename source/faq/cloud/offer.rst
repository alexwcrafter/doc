GLPI Cloud offer
----------------

What's included in the price?
*****************************

GLPI cloud is a :abbr:`maintenance in operational condition <MOC>` support/in-service support package.
We fix bugs that you may encounter, we apply security patches, and as planned with you we carry out minor and major updates.

If you wish to benefit from other services (assistance support, advice and assistance with configuration, developments, etc.): this is done under additional estimate/cost (from one of our official partners) after studying your request.

Your GLPI Network Cloud instance is packed with plugins already installed on the platform by default, here is a quick overview.

FusionInventory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Main features of the FusionInventory plugin are:

* dynamic inventory of computers, servers and other equipment compatible with Windows / Linux / Mac operating system on which a collector agent can be installed (this is called "local inventory")
* package broadcasting from the GLPI server to the deployed agents (applications, files, etc.);
* discovery and inventory of active elements in your IP network (via SNMP protocol);
* remote inventory of VmWare ESX, ESXi and vCenter servers (> = 3.5);
* agentless inventory deployed to Windows computers / servers on which WMI requests can be made (with AD domain authentication)
* inventory of Android phones (with the GLPI Agent application).

Print PDF
^^^^^^^^^

This plugin allows you to export in a single PDF file element of GLPI with all  properties, here are some examples:

* Export a PDF file of a ticket with all the follow-ups, the solutions provided and all its history
* Export a PDF file of computerÂ´s characteristics (components, disks, software, history, etc.)

When you navigate in GLPI, if you see a `PDF printing` tab on an object that you are viewing, it means that it is compatible with this plugin and you can export its elements in a file.
